# Revamp

Yeah I'm branching my own fork, what of it?

I suspect some of the things I've broken are broken because I don't fully understand why and how the original project works the way it does.

This is an attempt to recreate it, from the ground up, to do what I want it to.

## Nota Bene

I do not pretend I know what I'm doing here. This fork is likely to be a total disaster. You're much better off using the original. Everything here should be considered a does-not-work in progress. I know what I'm trying to do, and I'm sure there are many people smarter than me who could knock it up in ten minutes or less, but I'm using this fork to learn, so please don't jump in. Don't worry, I'll ask when I'm really losing it.

That said, you can of course fork from here and do whatever you like!
