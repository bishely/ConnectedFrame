# Nota Bene

I do not pretend I know what I'm doing here. This fork is likely to be a total disaster. You're much better off using the original. Everything here should be considered a does-not-work in progress. I know what I'm trying to do, and I'm sure there are many people smarter than me who could knock it up in ten minutes or less, but I'm using this fork to learn, so please don't jump in. Don't worry, I'll ask when I'm really losing it.

That said, you can of course fork from here and do whatever you like!

# Connected Picture Frame with resin.io

This project is about a digital picture frame aimed at family members, such as grandparents.

The idea is that parents taking pictures of their children, can easily share those pictures with the children's grandparents by making them appear on the picture frame automatically. In turn, the grandparents can "like" the pictures, letting the children's parents know which pictures are their favourites.

By making use of a specific software framework called resin.io, multiple instances of this picture frame can be deployed for various family members, without hassle.
